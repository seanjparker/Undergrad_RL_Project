This project would not have been possible without the help and support of those with whom I have discussed my project with over the past year. Firstly I would like to thank my supervior, Dr. Konstantin Korovin, who provided continuous help and guidance throughout all stages of this project. I would also like to express my gratitude to Dr. David Lester for his insights and guidance during the initial stages of this project.

Finally, I thank my friends and family, especially Sara, for all their support, inspiration and encouragement over the last year.
