One of the main aims of this project was to implement specific algorithms and techniques that are used in deep reinforcement learning to achieve human-like (or super human) performance in Atari 2600 games. In addition, this project describes a method to visualize the convolutional layers of the Q-function approximator which can provide insights into what information the agent is learning.
