\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude this project, one must reflect upon all stages of the research and development process. Firstly, a major part of this project was to research and understand the Q-Learning methods that can be applied to play video games. Additionally, I wanted to research ways to improve the stability of the algorithm through methods like Double and Duelling Q-Learning which are described in Section \ref{dsgn:sec:qlearning:doubledqn} and \ref{dsgn:sec:qlearning:dueldqn} respectively. A major hurdle in the development of this project was that at that start of the year, I was not familiar with the area of reinforcement learning, thus, by starting with the basics of the field, it provided a solid foundation which allowed me to develop a proof of concept of the agent during the Christmas break.

As was mentioned in the experiments chapter, although the agents were trained for a maximum of 20 million frames which is only a fifth of the training time used in the papers which first published the methods, the results produced shows that I built a fully working implementation of all of the methods, with the expected outcome. Each of the improvements described in the design chapter improved the performance of the Q-learning algorithm despite the limited training time and compute resources. This project also contributed to the unnderstanding of how these Q-learning algorithms work internally since we visualise the convolutional layers of the network as well of the output layer (Q-values) which can indicate which how well the agent is learning the environment.

In the field of RL, there has been a fast development of new techniques which are both more stable and better performining than Q-networks; examples of which are A3C, PPO and TODO. This provides many avenues which researchers could persue to perform further research into the field and one which I am personally looking forward to following in the future.
