\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}
My project aims to replicate some of the reinforcement learning algorithms that can be used to play classic Atari 2600 games. It also compares the results of different tests with these algorithms such as varying the hyperparameters of the network. By observing the effects on the trained agents\footnote{Agent. In our case, agent refers to a trained neural network that takes actions in a chosen environment.} when the hyperparameters are changed we can deduce a set of optimal values such that the networks can play three different Atari 2600 games. Overall, the main features of the project are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Agents with raw pixel game data as input, outputting a set of values for the best action.
	\item Agents attempt to find an optimal model of the environment without any prior knowledge.
	\item Visualization of the agent ``brain'' to provide insight into what information the agents is learning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:moti}
Over the past 10 years there has been significant improvement in the RL (reinforcement learning) algorithms. One reason is that the computing power has become cheaply available by using discrete graphics cards. For example, for my project I used a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 that provides 1920 CUDA cores that can be used to accelerate training of neural networks. Despite this, RL algorithms are massively computationally expensive and therefore take a long time to train.

Over recent years one of the pioneers in this area is DeepMind, which was acquired by Google in 2014, and they developed the DQN (deep q-network) algorithm in 2013 which they demonstrated could learn directly from the raw pixel data of games in order to achieve either human-level or super-human level performance.

This research was expanded upon by DeepMind and OpenAI which is based on the original DQN by DeepMind. This research focused on trying to approximate a Q-function and thereby infer the optimal policy. On the otherhand, there has recently been a focus on other methods such as A3C/PPO which instead seek to directly optimise in the policy space of the environment.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:obj}

\section{Report structure}

\LaTeX\ is not a WYSIWYG system. You first prepare source files,
\textsf{report.tex} etc., similar to the ones here, using your
favourite text editor color.

The UNIX commands you need to drive \LaTeX\ are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \texttt{latex.} Output from \texttt{latex} can be previewed on
	      the screen with \texttt{xdvi} or \texttt{gsprev} (under X), and printed on the laserprinter using  \texttt{dvips}.
	      \texttt{latex} produces \textsf{.dvi} files which are used by
	      \texttt{xdvi} or \texttt{gsprev} and \texttt{dvipr}.  To get all the
	      cross references and the table of contents correct you sometimes
	      need to run this command twice in succession.  Keep on re-running
	      until the advice to rerun at the end of the output goes away.

	      Many people now use \texttt{pdflatex} instead of \texttt{latex} to produce \texttt{pdf} files directly.

	\item \texttt{xdvi} or a pdf viewer such as \texttt{xpdf}, \texttt{evince} or \texttt{Preview} (Mac OS X). Previews the document on the
	      screen, again the parameter is \textsf{report} (or \texttt{report.pdf}).

	\item \texttt{dvips.} This is used to print dvi files on the laserprinter.  The
	      parameter is again \texttt{report}. Most pdf previewers provide their own printing interface.

	\item \texttt{xfig}. Can be used to produce diagrams, see
	      section~\ref{sec:diagrams}.

\end{enumerate}
There are on-line manual pages for each of the commands described above.

The set of files used to produce this document is in
\textsf{/opt/info/doc/latex} (in one of the subdirectories
\textsf{3rd-yr} or \textsf{MU-Thesis}).  They are also on the web at \url{http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/latex/MUThesis/}.

You will find that for more detailed points you will need to refer to
Lamport's `\LaTeX\ a document preparation system'~\cite{lamport}
(Copies in the library  in Blackwell's).
This example has been written using the most recent version of \LaTeX
(LaTeX2e), which is described in the \emph{2nd edition} of Lamport's
book. Buying a cheap copy of the 1st edition is probably not a good
investment. An alternative to Lamport's book, which some people
prefer, is `A guide to {\LaTeXe}' by Kopka and Daly~\cite{kopka}. The
older `A guide to {\LaTeX}'~\cite{kopka-old} by the same authors is
now obsolete. There is also plenty of support material for \LaTeX\ on the web.

\section{Software Environment}
\subsection{Occam}

Here is some more example text, showing various \LaTeX\ facilities
you may need.  The project was mostly programmed in
\textbf{Occam}~\cite{occam}.  (A citation has been created  here to an
entry in the bibliography at the end of the report. See
chapter~\ref{cha:bib} for more details on how to do this).

Note the way of getting boldface, \textit{textit} is used for italic.
\emph{emph} is used for emphasis and is the same as italic except when
already in italic.  Note the cross reference to the bibliography.
This is how you create a footnote: DMA\footnote{Direct Memory Access.
	Footnotes can stretch over more than one line if you have a lot to
	say, but be careful not to overdo them.}.

Here is a reference to a figure. See figure~\ref{pipeline}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\input{pipeline}
	\caption{A Pipeline of processors
		\label{pipeline}}           %  this label must appear after the
	%  \caption, and before the end of the
	%  figure
\end{figure}
The picture in this figure was created the hard way using the picture
facility of \LaTeX. It is \emph{much} easier to use \texttt{xfig}, as
described in section~\ref{sec:diagrams}.  Whatever its contents, a
figure `floats' to a `suitable' point in the text and is never split
across a page boundary. (\LaTeX's idea of what constitutes a suitable
point may not coincide with yours)


Now we have a verbatim environment; this is a useful way of including
snippits of program, printed in a fixed width font exactly as typed:

\begin{verbatim}
{{{ An example of some folds
...  This is some folded code
  {{{ This is another fold
  This is text within the fold that has now been
  opened so that the text can be read.
  }}}
}}}
\end{verbatim}

% emacs tex support system called auctex. If you're not an emacs user
% you can safely ignore it. If you do use emacs you should take a look
% at the local emacs or LaTeX WWW pages for more on emacs support for
